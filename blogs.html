            <p class="sectionsubtag text_small">Yoga is a generic term for physical, mental and spiritual disciplines, originated from ancient India. It is a spiritual and ascetic discipline including breath control, simple meditation and adoption of specific body postures, practiced for health and relaxation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Sanskrit term 'Yuj' means to Unite/Integrate a persons own consciousness with the universal consciousness. It is a harmonious blend between the body, mind and the spirit, wherein the body controls the actions, the mind controls intelligence and the spirit controls emotion.</p>
            <br>     
            <p>BBody	Controls action	Involves exercising</p>
            <p>Mind	Controls intelligence	Imcludes breathing techniques</p>
            <p>Spirit	Controls emotion	Includes meditation</p>
            <br>     
            <p>Thus, yoga teaches that the jeevatmaa (human spirit) can be united with paramatmaa (God) to secure moksha (liberation).</p>
            <br>
            <h2>History of Yoga</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Yoga has continued to evolve with time and can roughly be divided into:</p>
                <p>Pre-Classical Yoga: originated in the Indus-Sarasvati civilization in Northern India over 5,000 years ago with scriptures present in Rig veda and Upanishads. This form of yoga modified the idea of ritual sacrifice from the Vedas and internalized it, teaching the sacrifice of the ego through self-knowledge, action (karma yoga) and wisdom (jnana yoga).</p>
                <br>
                <p>Classical Yoga: Defined by Patanjaliâ€™s Yoga-Sutras, the first systematic presentation of yoga. Patanjali is considered the father of Yoga and still influences many practices of modern Yoga.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Post-Classical Yoga: rejected the teachings of the ancient Vedas and embraced the physical body as the means to achieve enlightenment. This exploration of physical-spiritual connections and body centered practices led to the creation of what we primarily think of yoga in the West: Hatha Yoga.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Modern Period: Swamy Vivekananda presented hatha yoga to the western world and laid the foundation for the growth and innovations that we see today.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Principles of Yoga</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Patanjali's classification of classical yoga, as set out in his Yoga Sutras explained 8 limbs of yoga as Yama (universal moral codes), niyama (self purification by discipline), asana (postures), pranayama (rhythmic control of breath), pratyahara (withdrawing of mind from senses), dharana (Concentration), dhayana (deep meditation) and samadhi (union with the object of meditation). He underlined these eight limbs as the core principles to be followed to attain Moksha.</p>
