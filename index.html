            <p class="sectionsubtag text_small">This advanced bodybuilder workout is designed to destroy each muscle group once a week over 5 days! Monday you will hit shoulders, Tuesday for arms, Wednesday for legs, Thursday for back and Friday for Chest. To look after the mid-section you will be doing 1 abdominal exercise at the end of each daily workout.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Workout Schedule:</h2>
            <p>Monday - Shoulders and Abs</p>
            <p>Tuesday - Arms and Abs</p>
            <p>Wednesday -  Legs and Abs</p>
            <p>Thursday - Back and Abs</p>
            <p>Friday - Chest and Abs</p>
            <p>Saturday - Rest</p>
            <p>Sunday - Rest</p>
            <br>
            <p>To get the maximum results from this workout you will need to vary it up a bit. The best way to do this is by supersetting the exercises. You should superset a compound and isolation exercise each day, every 3rd week. That should keep your muscles guessing. Use this advanced bodybuilder workout for 8-12 weeks then change it up.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text_big">Bodybuilding Nutrition: Foods to Eat and Avoid</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text_small">Like training, diet is a vital part of bodybuilding.
                Eating the right foods in the appropriate amounts provides your muscles with the nutrients they need to recover from workouts and grow bigger and stronger.
                Conversely, consuming the wrong foods or not enough of the right ones will leave you with subpar results.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Foods to Focus On</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Meats, poultry, and fish: Sirloin steak, ground beef, pork tenderloin, venison, chicken breast, salmon, tilapia, and cod.</p>
                <p>Dairy: Yogurt, cottage cheese, low fat milk, and cheese.</p>
                <p>Grains: Bread, cereal, crackers, oatmeal, quinoa, popcorn, and rice.</p>
                <p>Fruits: Oranges, apples, bananas, grapes, pears, peaches, watermelon, and berries.</p>
                <p>Starchy vegetables: Potatoes, corn, green peas, green lima beans, and cassava.</p>
                <p>Vegetables: Broccoli, spinach, leafy salad greens, tomatoes, green beans, cucumber, zucchini, asparagus, peppers, and mushrooms.</p>
                <p>Seeds and nuts: Almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, chia seeds, and flax seeds.</p>
                <p>Beans and legumes: Chickpeas, lentils, kidney beans, black beans, and pinto beans.
                    Oils: Olive oil, flaxseed oil, and avocado oil.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Foods to Limit</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Alcohol: Alcohol can negatively affect your ability to build muscle and lose fat, especially if you consume it in excess.</p>
                <p>Added sugars: These offer plenty of calories but few nutrients. Foods high in added sugars include candy, cookies, doughnuts, ice cream, cake, and sugar-sweetened beverages, such as soda and sports drinks.</p>
                <p>Deep-fried foods: These may promote inflammation and — when consumed in excess — disease. Examples include fried fish, french fries, onion rings, chicken strips, and cheese curds.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Bodybuilding Supplements</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Whey protein: Consuming whey protein powder is an easy and convenient way to increase your protein intake.</p>
                <p>Creatine: Creatine provides your muscles with the energy needed to perform an additional rep. While there are many brands of creatine, look for creatine monohydrate as it’s the most effective.</p>
                <p>Caffeine: Caffeine decreases fatigue and allows you to work harder. Pre-workout supplements, coffee, and tea are often high in caffeine.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text_big">Why Do We Stretch?</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text_small">When we stretch we have a higher chance of feeling better after a workout. It helps with muscle soreness and increases flexibility. It also helps you lengthen your muscles to improve performance.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Few benefits of stretching include:</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Reduced delayed onset muscle soreness following a workout.</p>
                <p>Increased blood flow, which helps to deliver more nutrients and oxygen to your muscles after exercise.</p>
                <p>Reduced risk of injury by increasing flexibility in the joints and connective tissues surrounding the joint.</p>
                <p>Improves your posture by releasing tightness in the back and neck.</p>
                <p>Improves your range of motion for everyday activities because you can move through a greater range of motion.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Best Time To Stretch Is After A Workout</h2>
                <br>
                <p> Stretching before a workout can make your muscles looser and warm up the body, however, stretching after accomplishes both of those benefits while also increasing blood flow which helps with muscle recovery from either an intense or light workout.</p>
